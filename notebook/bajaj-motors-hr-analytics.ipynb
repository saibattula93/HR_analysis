Naturally, people who are working on more projects would also be working for longer hours. However, a other things are notable from the visualizations.\n\n1. We see two prominent groups of employees who exited the company: (A) those whose average monthly hours are less than their peers, and (B) those who worked much more hours than their peers. Group A possibly includes those who were fired or employees who had already given their notice and were assigned fewer tasks because they were already on their way out of the company. For those in group B, it is reasonable to infer that these are the ones that quit. The employees in group B might have been the largest contributors to their projects. \n\n2. All employees who were assigned with seven projects left the company, and the interquartile ranges of this group and those who left with six projects was about 255 to 295 hours/week, which is much more than any other group. \n\n3. The optimal number of projects for employees to work on seems to be 3&ndash;4 since the ratio of left/stayed is very small for these groups.\n\n4. Assuming a work week of 40 hours and two weeks of vacation per year, the average number of working hours per month of employees working Monday&ndash;Friday `= 50 weeks * 40 hours per week / 12 months = 166.7 hours per month`. This means that, aside from the employees who worked on only two projects, every group&mdash;even those who did not leave the company&mdash;worked considerably more hours than this. It seems that employees in the company are overworked.\n\n5. In addition, the increase in mean hours for people working on more projects were much more evident for the people who left than those people who stayed.

To improve employee retention, this study recommends the following:\n\n* Restrict the number of projects that the employees get assigned to. Set the limit to 5 projects.\n* Re-evaluate project timelines and expectations, taking into account the amount of effort the employees can provide without overworking them. This can be done by assuming each employee can work for only 8 hours per day and has two weeks of vacation annually.\n* Consider hiring more people so the employees need not work overtime.\n* Continue and recalibrate the employee evaluation system to make sure those employees who contribute more or put in more effort have high evaluation scores.\n* Investigate if employees are paid accordingly when they work overtime. If not, inform employees about company policies regarding overtime pay and make these policies explicit. If they are paid accordingly for working overtime, anticipate the effects on employee satisfaction when they are getting limited overtime, thus, lower overall pay as well. The decrease in satisfaction due to lower overall pay can be mitigated by implementing a salary increase for all employees, or those with satisfactory to high evaluation scores.\n* Create an Award System that will reward employees upon reaching a certain number of years in the company.\n* Conduct further investigation why four-year tenured employees have very low satisfaction levels. Also, consider giving them incentives when they reach the four-year mark in the company.\n* Initiate company-wide and team-wide retrospectives and discussions to understand and address issues with company culture.\n\nTo further improve the results of this study, it is recommended to consider other factors that might affect an employee's decision to leave such as the distance between the company and the employee's residence, their salary growth in the past years, participation in activities that encourage work-life balance, and opportunities for growth in the company.","metadata":{}}]}

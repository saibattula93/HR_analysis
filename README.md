# Employee Retention Prediction Model

## 1. Overview
This project involves a predictive model to determine whether employees are likely to leave or stay within the company.

## 2. Motivation
The objective is to assist HR departments in identifying employees at risk of leaving and implementing retention strategies.

## 3. Success Metrics
Model success will be measured by accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score for predicting employee turnover.

## 4. Requirements & Constraints
### 4.1 Functional Requirements
- Access to employee data including job history, performance, and other relevant features.
- Python environment with necessary libraries.
- Data preprocessing scripts.

### 4.2 Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance, accuracy, and maintainable code.
- Ethical handling of employee data.

### 4.3 Constraints
- Limited to structured employee data.
- Model's predictions depend on input data quality.

### 4.4 Out-of-Scope
- Real-time predictions.
- External factors not explicitly included.

## 5. Methodology
### 5.1 Problem Statement
Predict employee attrition as a binary classification task using historical employee data.

### 5.2 Data
Employee records with attributes like tenure, performance ratings, promotions, salary, etc.

### 5.3 Techniques
Apply classification algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks. Feature engineering and selection will be employed.

## 6. Architecture
Data collection -> Data preprocessing -> Feature engineering -> Model training -> Evaluation.

## 7. Pipeline
1. Data Collection: Gather employee data.
2. Data Preprocessing: Clean, handle missing values.
3. Feature Engineering: Create relevant features.
4. Model Training: Train classification models.
5. Evaluation: Measure model performance.

## 8. Conclusion
Predictive model aids in employee retention efforts. Model's efficacy depends on data quality and appropriate techniques. Potential for real-time deployment and broader external factor analysis in future.
